## B.3 Axiom Ablation Analysis

The axiomatization developed above is not merely a convenient characterization—it reveals the fundamental structure of contradiction as a resource.

In this resource theory, frame-independent behaviors $\mathrm{FI}$ constitute the free objects, the free operations consist of 

1. outcome post-processing by arbitrary stochastic kernels $\Lambda_c$ applied within each context $c$,
2. public lotteries over contexts (independent of outcomes and hidden variables), and the contradiction measure $K$ serves as a faithful, convex, additive monotone: $K(P) \geq 0$ with equality precisely on $\mathrm{FI}$, $K$ is non-increasing under free operations, and $K$ is additive for independent systems (noting that for $|\mathcal{C}|=1$, all axioms collapse correctly and $K \equiv 0$).

To establish the robustness of this framework, we examine both weakenings and violations of each axiom. This analysis serves two purposes: it demonstrates that our axioms capture the minimal necessary structure, and it illuminates how each constraint contributes to the theory's coherence.

#### B.3.1 Axiom Weakening

Several axioms admit natural weakenings that preserve the main theoretical results while relaxing technical requirements:

**Continuity Relaxation (A2).** 

Full continuity in the product $\|\cdot\|_1$ metric can be weakened to lower semicontinuity of $K$ (equivalently, upper semicontinuity of $\alpha^\star$). This suffices because our proofs require continuity only to ensure the existence of optima and to prevent discontinuous jumps at the $\mathrm{FI}$ boundary. Lower semicontinuity guarantees both properties directly.

**Grouping Decomposition (A4).** 

The grouping axiom equivalently follows from two more primitive requirements: *replication invariance* (duplicating any context row leaves $K$ unchanged) and *context anonymity* (permutation invariance over contexts). These conditions together imply invariance under public lotteries over contexts that are independent of outcomes and hidden variables—the lottery-splitting invariance employed in our main results.

**Compositional Robustness (A5).** 

When $\mathrm{FI}_{A\times B}$ fails to be strictly product-closed, exact additivity still holds for the product-closed hull $\overline{\mathrm{FI}_A\otimes \mathrm{FI}_B}$—the smallest convex, closed set containing all products:

$$
Q_A\in \mathrm{FI}_A,\quad Q_B\in \mathrm{FI}B
\;\Longrightarrow\;
Q_A\otimes Q_B \in \mathrm{FI}{A\times B}.
$$

More generally, we obtain subadditivity $K(P\otimes R) \leq K(P) + K(R)$ with equality precisely when the optimal dual weights factorize across $A$ and $B$ (i.e., $\lambda^\star{A\times B} = \lambda^\star_A \otimes \lambda^\star_B$)—a condition that can be verified independently.

We now demonstrate that each axiom is essential by constructing explicit counterexamples that satisfy all remaining axioms while violating the target property. 

#### B.3.2 Label Invariance (A0).

*Counterexample:* Define $\tilde K(P) := \|p(\cdot\!\mid c_0) - p(\cdot\!\mid c_1)\|_1$ for fixed context labels $c_0, c_1$.
*Failure mode:* Context relabeling changes $\tilde K$ despite identical behavioral content, violating the principle that physical properties should depend only on operational statistics.

#### B.3.3 FI-Characterization (A1).

*Counterexample:* Define $\tilde K(P) := \min_c \|p(\cdot\!\mid c) - u\|_1$ where $u$ is the uniform distribution.
*Failure mode:* For $P \in \mathrm{FI}$ with non-uniform rows, $\tilde K(P) > 0$, incorrectly assigning nonzero contradiction to some frame-independent behaviors.

#### B.3.4 Continuity (A2).

*Counterexample:* Define $\tilde K(P) := \mathbf{1}\{\alpha^\star(P) < 1\}$.
*Failure mode:* Consider a sequence $P_n \to P$ with $\alpha^\star(P_n) \uparrow 1$. Then $\tilde K(P_n) = 1$ for all $n$, but $\tilde K(P) = 0$, creating a discontinuous jump at the $\mathrm{FI}$ boundary.

#### B.3.5 Data-Processing Monotonicity (A3).

*Counterexample:* Replace Bhattacharyya coefficient with linear overlap:

$$
\tilde\alpha(P) := \max_{Q\in\mathrm{FI}} \min_c \langle p_c, q_c \rangle, \quad \tilde K := -\log \tilde\alpha
$$

*Failure mode:* Linear overlap fails as a data-processing monotone. For example, take $p=q=(1,0)$ with linear overlap $\langle p,q\rangle=1$. Coarse-graining with 

$$
\Lambda=\begin{pmatrix}
\tfrac12 & \tfrac12\\[2pt]
\tfrac12 & \tfrac12
\end{pmatrix} 
$$

gives $\Lambda p=\Lambda q=(1/2,1/2)$ and $\langle \Lambda p,\Lambda q\rangle=1/2<1$, so similarity decreases under processing, allowing coarse-graining to artificially increase contradiction.

#### B.3.6 Context Grouping (A4).

*Counterexample:* Define

$$
\tilde\alpha(P) := \max_{Q\in\mathrm{FI}} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|} \sum_c \mathrm{BC}(p_c, q_c), \quad \tilde K := -\log \tilde\alpha

$$

*Failure mode:* When one context acts as a bottleneck (smallest Bhattacharyya coefficient), duplicating that context row decreases the arithmetic mean, causing $\tilde K$ to increase despite unchanged behavioral content.

#### B.3.7 Additivity (A5).

*Counterexample:* Retain Bhattacharyya coefficient but use non-logarithmic aggregation $h(x) = 1-x$:

$$
\tilde K(P) = 1 - \alpha^\star(P)
$$

*Failure mode:* For independent systems $P = R$ with $\alpha^\star(P) = 1/2$, we get $\tilde K(P \otimes P) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4$ while $\tilde K(P) + \tilde K(P) = 1$, violating additivity (indeed, this aggregator yields strict subadditivity in general). 

<aside>

Note that additivity on independent products forces $h(xy) = h(x) + h(y)$ (the functional equation for logarithms). 

With domain $h:(0,1] \to [0,\infty)$, normalization $h(1)=0$, monotonicity ($x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow h(x_1) \geq h(x_2)$), and continuity, the Cauchy functional equation uniquely determines $h(x) = -k\log x$. 

Choosing bits as our unit fixes $k=1/\ln 2$, yielding $h(x) = -\log_2 x$. (Note that as $\alpha^\star \downarrow 0$, $K \to \infty$, properly capturing "complete contradiction" with infinite information cost.)

</aside>

#### B.3.8 Ablation Summary

Thus, additivity on independent systems forces a logarithmic form. Fixing base-2 units (bits) then yields the unique measure consistent with A0–A5:

$$
K(P) \;=\; -\log_2 \alpha^\star(P).
$$

Equivalently, every halving of $\alpha^\star$ increases $K$ by one bit. Any other admissible measure is merely a unit change—a positive rescaling or a different logarithm base (i.e., a constant multiple of $K$). This completes the violation analysis and confirms that our axioms capture the minimal structure necessary for a coherent theory of contradiction as a resource.
