## 1.3 Structure and Scope

The paper moves from motivation → mechanism → consequences. While §§1–2 motivate the need for a single yardstick and ground it in a concrete device; §§3–5 build the calculus; §6 shows operational theorems; §7 provides operational interpretations; §§8–10 place, bound, and extend the results; while the appendices supply proofs and worked cases.

**Overview:**

- Motivation by example (§2). The Lenticular Coin is a minimal classical device exhibiting odd-cycle incompatibility; it previews how $K(P)$ registers contradiction in bits.
- Framework → axioms → results (§§3–5). §3 formalizes observables, contexts (frames), behaviors, the baseline $\mathrm{FI}$, Bhattacharyya overlap, and the minimax program (with standing assumptions). §4 states and motivates axioms A0–A5. §5 presents the main theorems, including the fundamental formula $K(P)=-\log_2 \alpha^{\star}(P)$ and additivity.
- From quantity to consequences (§6) and practice (§7). §6 presents operational theorems in discrimination, simulation, and prediction. §7 provides operational interpretations with a practical minimax program for $\alpha^{\star}$, a plug-in estimator for $K$ with bootstrap intervals.
- Context and boundaries (§§8–10). §8 positions the work relative to contextuality, Dempster–Shafer, social choice, and information distances. §9 states limitations and scope. §10 sketches near-term extensions. App. A contains full proofs and technical lemmas; App. B holds worked examples, and App. C offers case studies for review.

**How to read:**

- For guarantees, skim §2, then read §§3–5 for the formal core and §6 for operational meaning; see App. A for proofs.
- For implementation, jump from §2 to §§6–7 (algorithms, estimation), backfilling definitions from §3 as needed; see App. B for worked cases.

**Scope:**

Throughout we assume finite alphabets and the usual compatibility/no-disturbance setting. The baseline $\mathrm{FI}$ is nonempty, compact, convex, and product-closed—hence a polytope for finite alphabets. Results are domain-general in the following sense: once $\mathrm{FI}$ is specified for a given domain, the same scalar $K(P)$ applies without modification, with a calibrated zero ($K=0$ iff $P\in \mathrm{FI}$) and shared units across cases.
