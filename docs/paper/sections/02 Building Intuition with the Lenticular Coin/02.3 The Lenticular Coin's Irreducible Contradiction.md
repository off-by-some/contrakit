## **2.3 The Lenticular Coin's Irreducible Contradiction**

Having built intuition around perspective and missing information, we arrive to the paper's purpose: a type of contradiction that persists even when context is fully preserved and the setup is completely transparent. 



But this time, we disallow ambiguity:

---

**Axiom (Single-Valued Reports).**

1. **Each observer must report a single word: YES or NO.**
2. **No BOTH entries allowed.**

---



Consider the same lenticular coin, now mounted on a motorized turntable that rotates in precise increments. Three observers—Nancy, Dylan, Tyler—sit at fixed viewing angles along the viewing axis. The lenticular surface shows $\text{YES}$ at $0^\circ$, $\text{NO}$ at $180^\circ$, and $\text{BOTH}$ at the transition $90^\circ$ (with half-width $w_{\text{both}}$). Fix three platform orientations that graze but avoid the transition band:
$$
\psi_1=0^\circ,\qquad \psi_2=90^\circ-\varepsilon,\qquad \psi_3=180^\circ-\varepsilon,\quad \text{with }\varepsilon > w_{\text{both}}+\delta.
$$
At each orientation $\psi_k$, the platform stops; exactly two observers look while the third looks away (no omniscient snapshot).

The three rounds:
| Round | Orientation $\psi$      | Observers    | Reports                  |
| ----: | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
|     1 | $0^\circ$               | Nancy, Tyler | $\text{YES},\ \text{NO}$ |
|     2 | $90^\circ-\varepsilon$  | Tyler, Dylan | $\text{NO},\ \text{YES}$ |
|     3 | $180^\circ-\varepsilon$ | Dylan, Nancy | $\text{NO},\ \text{YES}$ |

Every local report is valid for lenticular viewing. As §§2.1–2.2 established, once the codebook is fixed, the local laws $(S,P)\!\mapsto\!O$ render each context coherent; the only failure we saw came from dropping $P$, not from the law—and that was fixed by modeling $P$. But here, a different question creates a different failure mode: can we assign each person a single, round-independent label ($\text{YES}$/$\text{NO}$) that matches all three pairwise observations?

The rounds impose:
$$
\text{Nancy} \neq \text{Tyler},\quad \text{Tyler} \neq \text{Dylan},\quad \text{Dylan} \neq \text{Nancy}.
$$



To make it tactile, imagine the conversation between Tyler, Dylan, and Nancy:

| **Round**                               | **Nancy**                     | **Tyler**                    | **Dylan**                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Round 1 —$\psi_1=0^\circ$               | "From here I see YES."        | "Strange, because I see NO." | "I didn't look this round." |
| Round 2 —$\psi_2=90^\circ-\varepsilon$  | "I wasn't looking this time." | "Again I see NO."            | "Well I see YES."           |
| Round 3 —$\psi_3=180^\circ-\varepsilon$ | "From my seat I see YES."     | "I sat out this one."        | "Now I see NO."             |

When asked to collectively describe how the coin operated, they would be unable to reach agreement, despite each telling the truth. The series of observations created a situation where no single, coherent description of the coin could accommodate all their valid experiences. The local laws are all obeyed, yet there is no single global law—no fixed YES/NO per person—that makes all three pairs correct at once.

This is the classic **odd-cycle impossibility**: three pairwise "not equal" constraints cannot be satisfied by any global assignment. This forms the minimal odd-cycle obstruction, directly mirroring the KCBS contextuality test in spin-1 systems. Each observation is right in its context, yet no frame-independent set of labels can satisfy all three at once. The incompatibility isn't noise; it's geometric. 




​	Even an omniscient observer must choose a frame. You can know everything—
​	but not from one place.



This differs from the missing-context case in §2.2: carrying the frame there resolved ambiguity. Here, even with perfect context preservation, no frame-independent summary exists. The three questions, asked in sequence, admit no coherent single-story answer. The turntable is simple, not exotic; one could build this in a classroom.

Information-theoretically, "no global law" means there is no joint $Q\in\mathrm{FI}$ whose every context marginal matches $P$. Classical information theory can represent each context separately once $\psi$ is included among the variables; what it was *never designed* to represent under a single $Q$ is precisely the odd-cycle pattern. At best, two of the three pairwise constraints can be satisfied, so the irreducible disagreement rate is 1/3 per cycle.

Consequently, any frame-independent approximation must be wrong in at least one context. Numbers computed under a unified $Q$—entropy, code length, likelihood, mutual information, test-error exponents—are systematically misspecified. The gap is quantifiable: coding incurs $D(P\|Q^{\star})$ extra bits per sample for $Q^{\star}=\arg\min_{Q\in\mathrm{FI}} D(P\|Q)$; testing exponents are capped by $\alpha^{\star}(P)<1$ (equivalently, $K=-\log_2 \alpha^{\star}(P)$). 

Quantitatively, the best frame-independent agreement is $ \alpha^{\star}=\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}}$ so the contradiction bit count is
$$
K(P)=-\log_2 \alpha^{\star}(P)=\tfrac{1}{2}\log_2\!\frac{3}{2}\approx 0.2925\ \text{bits per flip}.
$$
This is the **contradiction bit**: the per-observation cost of compressing all perspectives into one coherent view. The optimal dual weights are uniform, $\lambda^{\star}=(1/3,1/3,1/3)$, and the optimal $Q^{\star}$ saturates $\mathrm{BC}(p_c,q^{\star}_c)=\sqrt{2/3}$ in all three contexts.
