## 3.1 The Lenticular Coin, Reframed.

Let's be precise about what we measured when our three friends observed the lenticular coin:

- **Observables**: Things we can measure (like "what word does Nancy see?")
- **Contexts**: Different ways to probe the system (like "which pair of observers look simultaneously?")
- **Outcomes**: What actually happens when we look (like "Nancy sees $\text{YES}$, Tyler sees $\text{NO}$")
- **Behaviors**: The complete statistical pattern across all possible contexts

A **behavior** functions like a comprehensive experimental logbook. For every way you might probe the system, it records the probability distribution over what you'll observe. In our rotating coin experiment, this logbook includes entries like: "When Nancy and Tyler both look simultaneously, there's a 50% chance Nancy sees $\text{YES}$ while Tyler sees $\text{NO}$, a 50% chance Nancy sees $\text{NO}$ while Tyler sees $\text{YES}$, and 0% chance they agree."

The mathematical formalization captures this intuitive picture directly. We have observables $\mathcal{X} = \{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\}$, where each can display various outcomes. A **context** $c$ is simply a subset of observables we examine together. A **behavior** $P$ assigns to each context $c$ a probability distribution $p_c$ over the outcomes we might see (App. A.1.1–A.1.4).

This isn't exotic machinery—just systematic bookkeeping for multi-perspective experiments.
