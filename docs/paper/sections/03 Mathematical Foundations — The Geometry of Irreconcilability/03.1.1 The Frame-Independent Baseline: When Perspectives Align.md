### 3.1.1 The Frame-Independent Baseline: When Perspectives Align

Some behaviors exhibit no contradictions at all. Consider a simple coin that always shows the same face to every observer—heads to Nancy, heads to Dylan, heads to Tyler. Here, all perspectives align perfectly. Even though different people look at different times or from different angles, their reports weave into one coherent explanation: "The coin landed heads."

This represents **frame-independent** behavior: one underlying reality explains everything different observers see. Disagreements arise only because observers examine different aspects of the same coherent system, not because the system itself contains contradictions.

But our lenticular coin behaves differently. Nancy, Dylan, and Tyler see genuinely incompatible things that resist integration into any single coherent explanation. This represents **frame-dependent** behavior—the signature of irreducible contradiction.

Mathematically, a behavior is **frame-independent** when there exists a single "master explanation" that simultaneously accounts for what every context would observe. More precisely, there must be a probability distribution $\mu$ over complete global states such that each context's observations are simply different slices of these states. We remain entirely within **Kolmogorov's** classical probability—the frames are **labels on contexts**, not a departure from standard measure-theoretic modeling (Kolmogorov, 1956/1933).

A **complete global state** is a full specification of every observable simultaneously—like saying "Nancy sees $\text{YES}$, Dylan sees $\text{BOTH}$, Tyler sees $\text{NO}$" all at once. If such states exist and one distribution $\mu$ over them reproduces all our contextual observations, then we have our baseline.

Three equivalent ways to understand this baseline:

1. Unified explanation: All observations integrate into one coherent account
2. Hidden variable model: A single random "state of affairs" underlies what each context reveals
3. Geometric picture: The baseline is the convex hull of "deterministic global assignments"—scenarios where every observable has a definite value

In the sheaf-theoretic account, this is exactly the existence of a global section reproducing all contextual marginals *(Abramsky & Brandenburger, 2011)*.

The **frame-independent set** (App. A.1.6) contains all behaviors admitting such unified explanations. These form our "no-contradiction" baseline. Crucially, FI has excellent mathematical properties in our finite setting: it's nonempty, convex, compact, and closed. This gives us a solid foundation for measuring distances from it.

Two cases will matter later. If there exists $Q\in\mathrm{FI}$ with $Q=P$, then $\alpha^\star(P)=1$ and $K(P)=0$ (no contradiction). If no such $Q$ exists, then $\alpha^\star(P)<1$ and $K(P)>0$ quantifies the minimal deviation any unified account must incur to explain all contexts at once
