## 3.2 Measuring the Distance to Agreement

To quantify contradiction, we need a notion of "distance" between our observed behavior and the closest frame-independent explanation. When comparing probability distributions across multiple contexts, the Bhattacharyya coefficient provides exactly what we need.

For probability distributions $p$ and $q$ over the same outcomes:

$$
\text{BC}(p,q) = \sum_{\text{outcomes}} \sqrt{p(\text{outcome}) \cdot q(\text{outcome})}
$$

This measures "probability overlap" (Appendix A.2.1). When $p$ and $q$ are identical, $\text{BC}(p,q) = 1$ (perfect overlap). When they assign probability to completely disjoint supports, $\text{BC}(p,q) = 0$ (no overlap). Between these extremes, the coefficient tracks how much the distributions have in common.



Three properties make this measure particularly suitable:

**Perfect agreement detection**:
$\text{BC}(p,q) = 1$ if and only if $p = q$ (see Appendix A.2.2)

**Mathematical tractability**:
It's concave and well-behaved for optimization (see Appendix A.2.2)

**Compositional structure**: (see Appendix A.2.2)
For independent systems,
$$
\text{BC}(p_1 \otimes p_2, q_1 \otimes q_2) = \text{BC}(p_1,q_1) \cdot \text{BC}(p_2,q_2)
$$
