## 3.3 The Core Measurement: Maximum Achievable Agreement

Given an observed behavior $P$, we now address the central question: across all possible frame-independent behaviors, what's the maximum agreement we can achieve with our observations?

A subtle but important choice emerges. We could measure agreement context-by-context, then average. But which contexts deserve more weight? The natural answer: let the worst-case contexts determine the overall assessment. If even one context shows poor agreement with our proposed frame-independent explanation, that explanation fails to capture the true structure.



This leads to our **agreement measure** (App. A.3.1):

$$
\alpha^\star(P) = \max_{Q \in \text{FI}} \min_{\text{contexts } c} \text{BC}(p_c, q_c)
$$

The formula reads: "Among all frame-independent behaviors $Q$, find the one that maximizes the worst-case agreement with our observed behavior $P$ across all contexts."

The max-min structure captures something essential about contradiction. Perspective clash concerns **universal reconcilability**. A truly frame-independent explanation must account for *every* context satisfactorily. One persistently problematic context breaks the entire unified narrative.

This optimization problem has well-behaved mathematical structure. By Sion's minimax theorem, we can equivalently write:

$$ \alpha^\star(P) = \min_{\lambda\in\Delta(\mathcal{C})} \max_{Q \in \text{FI}} \sum_{\text{contexts } c} \lambda_c \cdot \text{BC}(p_c, q_c) $$

where $\lambda$ is a probability distribution over contexts. The optimal weighting $\lambda^\star$ identifies which contexts create the worst contradictions—they receive the highest weights in the sum. (see App. A.3)
