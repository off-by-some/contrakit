## 3.4 The Game-Theoretic Structure

The minimax formulation (Appendix A.3.2) reveals the deeper structure of contradiction, expressing the same quantity as a worst-case average:

$$ \alpha^\star(P) = \min_{\lambda\in\Delta(\mathcal{C})} \max_{Q \in \text{FI}} \sum_c \lambda_c \cdot \text{BC}(p_c, q_c) $$

This has the structure of a two-player game:

- **The Adversary**: Picks a weighting $\lambda$ over contexts—deciding where to focus attention, and which contradictions to stress
- **The Explainer**: Chooses a unified account $Q\in \mathrm{FI}$—a single story that tries to match the data as well as possible, under the adversary's chosen spotlight

The minimax theorem guarantees an equilibrium: a point $(\lambda^\star, Q^\star)$ where neither side can improve their outcome by moving alone.

At the balance point, three things happen (Theorem A.5.1):

- **$\lambda^\star$ locates the tension**: Contexts with large weight are the ones that resist reconciliation; they set the structural limit
- **$Q^\star$ is the best possible global fit**: It maximizes agreement with the observed behavior, given the worst-case emphasis
- **The active contexts all saturate the bound**: Wherever $\lambda^\star_c > 0$, the overlap $\mathrm{BC}(p_c, q_c^\star)$ equals $\alpha^\star(P)$. These are the tight spots; they define the score

**For our lenticular coin**, the symmetry forces a fair outcome:

- $\lambda^\star = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$: every context applies equal pressure
- $Q^\star$ assigns $(1/6,\ 1/3,\ 1/3,\ 1/6)$ to the four outcomes in each context (see Appendix B.2)
- $\alpha^\star(P) = \sqrt{2/3}$ and $K(P)=\frac{1}{2}\log_2\frac{3}{2}\approx 0.29$ bits per observation

This isn't coincidental—it reflects the nature of the lenticular coin's odd-cycle contradictions. No single participant was responsible for the contradiction; together, they establish the bound.
