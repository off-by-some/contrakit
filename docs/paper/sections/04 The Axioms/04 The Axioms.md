## 4. The Axioms

The six axioms we introduce are not inventions—they arise directly from the structural lessons of the lenticular coin. Each insight about how perspectives behave becomes a constraint on what any reasonable contradiction measure must respect.

Let's recall what the coin revealed:

1. Multiple valid perspectives can coexist.
2. Each perspective remains locally consistent.
3. Full agreement can be structurally impossible.
4. Ambiguity is lawful, but never accidental.
5. Modeling can fix ambiguity, not fundamental disagreement
6. Perspective is the substance of contradiction.
7. Contradictions obey patterns—they aren't noise.
8. Coordinating across views incurs real cost.

Taken together, these insights tell us what contradiction must be. They narrow the field of admissible measures—ruling out those that ignore ambiguity, neglect context, or fail to track structural strain. An ablation analysis is available within Appendix B.3 for readers that are interested. We'll now formalize these constraints as six axioms. They are elementary, but together, they uniquely determine the contradiction measure:
$$
K(P) = -\log_2 \alpha^\star(P)
$$
