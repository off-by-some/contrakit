### 4.1 Axiom A0: Label Invariance

> *Contradiction lives in the structure of perspectives—not within perspectives themselves.*


$K$ is invariant under outcome and context relabelings (permutations).

**This allows multiple perspectives to exist.** No matter whether Nancy said "YES," Dylan "NO," and Tyler "BOTH", they all could be written as $(1,0,\tfrac12)$ without changing anything operational. Only the *pattern of compatibility* matters.

**Without A0**, renaming outcomes or contexts could change the contradiction count. We could thus "game" $K$ by relabeling alone—despite identical experiments and decisions (App B.3.2). This would make $K$ about notation, not structure — leading to semantic bias where truth becomes cosmetic; privileging some vocabularies and allowing erasure of other perspectives.
