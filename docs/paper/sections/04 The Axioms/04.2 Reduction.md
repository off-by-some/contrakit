### 4.2 Axiom A1: Reduction

> *We cannot measure a contradiction if no contradiction exists.*

$$
K(P) = 0\ \text{iff}\ P \in \mathrm{FI}
$$

**This enables local consistency and indicates that full agreement can be structurally impossible.** Each person's story is valid, therefore each context obeys its own law; the clash appears only when we demand a single story across contexts. If a unified account $Q\in\mathrm{FI}$ already reproduces all contexts, no obstruction exists. Conversely, when $P\not\in\mathrm{FI}$, no $Q\in\mathrm{FI}$ can reproduce all contexts, so $K(P)>0$. The zero of the scale must sit exactly on $\mathrm{FI}$.

**Without A1**, even if every individual tells their story clearly, and no contradictions arise between them, the theory could still assign nonzero contradiction. We would lose the ability to distinguish structural conflict from peaceful coexistence. In such a world, $\mathrm{FI}$ would no longer anchor the notion of consistency—it would become unstable or ill-defined.

Multiple perspectives would exist but none could be valid. You'd have *plurality*—but not *legitimacy* (App B.3.3).
