### 4.3 Axiom A2: Continuity

> *Small disagreements deserve small measures.*


$K$ is continuous in the product $L_1$ metric:

$$
d(P,P') = \max_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \bigl\|p(\cdot|c) - p'(\cdot|c)\bigr\|_1
$$

**This is why ambiguity is lawful, but not accidental.** Tiny shifts in belief shouldn't cause outsized spikes in contradiction. Continuity ensures that small disagreements remain small in cost: if a behavior is nearly frame-independent, its contradiction measure is correspondingly minimal.

If Tyler moves from Nancy's position toward Dylan's, the coin's appearance shifts gradually from "YES" through ambiguous states to "NO." The contradiction doesn't jump discontinuously—it evolves smoothly with the changing perspective.

**Without A2** there is no continuous path toward resolution—contradiction either suddenly appears, or doesn't exist at all (App B.3.4). It's like saying war either is happening or it's not—and that there was never any in-between.
