### 4.4 Axiom A3: Free Operations

> *Structure lost may conceal contradiction — but never invent it.*

<aside>

For any free operation $\Phi$,

$$
\alpha^\star(\Phi(P)) \;\ge\; \alpha^\star(P) \qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad K(\Phi(P)) \;\le\; K(P).
$$

$K$ is monotone under:

1. stochastic post-processing of outcomes within each context $c$ (via kernels $\Lambda_c$);
2. splitting/merging contexts through public lotteries $Z$ independent of outcomes and hidden variables;
3. convex mixtures $\lambda P + (1-\lambda)P'$;
4. tensoring with frame-independent ancillas $R \in \mathrm{FI}$ (where $\Phi(P) = P \otimes R$) </aside>

**This is why modeling can fix ambiguity, not fundamental disagreement.** No amount of averaging Nancy's and Dylan's reports, no coarse-graining of their observations, no random mixing of their contexts can eliminate the fact that they see different things from their respective positions.

Within our example, the contradiction wasn't an artifact of how information is encoded—it was embedded into the geometry of perspective itself.  This axiom guarantees that any blurring, merging, or randomizing of information can mask contradiction, but never invent it. If a behavior shows contradictory after transformation, it was already contradictory before.

**Without A3**, we could inflate disagreement by simply mixing or simplifying—confusing noise with structure, and destroying the integrity of $K$ as a faithful witness to tension. (App B.3.5). You could take two people who completely agree, blur their positions, and find yourself facing a contradiction that wasn't there before. Or worse—you could take two people who fundamentally disagree, mix their perspectives randomly, and suddenly create consensus.

The monotonicity conditions mirror what **resolvability** and **synthesis** demand operationally (Han & Verdú, 1993; Cuff, 2013).
