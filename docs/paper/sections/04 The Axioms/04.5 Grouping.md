### 4.5 Axiom A4: Grouping

> *Contradiction is a matter of substance, not repetition.*


$K$ depends only on refined statistics when contexts are split via public lotteries, independent of outcomes and hidden variables. In particular, duplicating or removing identical rows leaves $K$ unchanged.

**This is what we saw in the example, perspective as the substance of contradiction.** Axiom A4 formalizes this by making $K$ insensitive to repetition or bookkeeping. Only the unique patterns of contextual incompatibility matter.

Whether Nancy states her observation once or ten times, her disagreement with Dylan remains the same. Repeating a context doesn't generate new evidence, and splitting it through public coin flips doesn't change what can be jointly satisfied. The contradiction isn't about how many times a perspective is reported—it's about the existence of distinct, irreconcilable perspectives.

**Without A4**, frequency—not structure—would drive contradiction (App B.3.6). We'd effectively agree that the loudest voice is the most valid perspective.
