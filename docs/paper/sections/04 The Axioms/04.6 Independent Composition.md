### 4.6 Axiom A5: Independent Composition

> *Contradictions compound; they do not cancel.*


For operationally independent behaviors on disjoint observable sets:

$$
K(P \otimes R) = K(P) + K(R)
$$
This requires that FI be closed under products: for any $Q_A \in \mathrm{FI}_A$ and $Q_B \in \mathrm{FI}*B$, we have $Q_A \otimes Q_B \in \mathrm{FI}*{A \sqcup B}.



**This is why contradictions obey patterns—they aren't noise.** Independent disagreements compound in a predictable way: if Nancy and Dylan clash about both the coin's political message and its artistic style, the total cost reflects both tensions.

This axiom guarantees that $K$ scales coherently. A disagreement about topic $A$ and a disagreement about topic $B$ together cost more than either alone.

**Without A5**, additivity would fail (Appendix B.3.7). A clash over pizza toppings might erase a clash over politics, as though disagreement in one domain could dissolve disagreement in another. Any operation that allowed such cancellations would reduce contradiction to noise—negotiable bookkeeping rather than a faithful measure of perspectival tension.
