## 4.1 Axioms: A Summary

| **Axiom**                        | **Phenomenon it encodes**                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **A0 — Label Invariance**        | Multiple valid perspectives can coexist.        |
| **A1 — Reduction**               | Each perspective remains locally consistent.    |
| **A1 — Reduction (again)**       | Full agreement can be structurally impossible.  |
| **A2 — Continuity**              | Ambiguity is lawful, but never accidental.      |
| **A3 — Free Operations**         | Modeling can fix ambiguity, not disagreement.   |
| **A4 — Grouping**                | Perspective is the substance of contradiction.  |
| **A5 — Independent Composition** | Contradictions obey patterns—they aren't noise. |
| **Combined Effect**              | Coordinating across views incurs real cost.     |

Taken together, the axioms force any contradiction measure to track what the data already taught us: some perspective-dependent behaviors carry an *irreducible coordination cost*—a cost that relabeling, coarse-graining, context averaging, or mixing cannot erase (they can only hide). Dropping any axiom breaks an observed regularity (label-invariance, calibrated zero, continuity, monotonicity under free operations, grouping, or additivity), and the measure stops reflecting the phenomenon we see in the Lenticular Coin and its variants.

Thus, under these constraints, a single form remains:

$$
K(P) = -\log_2 \alpha^\star(P)
$$
which inherits the conceptual content of the insight and supplies the precision of information theory. The **contradiction bit** is not an invention; it is the natural unit for the empirically observed price of forcing one story across genuinely incompatible perspectives.
