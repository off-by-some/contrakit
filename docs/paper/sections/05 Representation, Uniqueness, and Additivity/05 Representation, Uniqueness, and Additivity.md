## 5. Representation, Uniqueness, and Additivity

The axioms establish that disagreement between perspectives follow mathematical laws. In our finite-alphabet setting, joint concavity and product multiplicativity single out the Bhattacharyya/Rényi-½ kernel as the operational overlap (Bhattacharyya, 1943; Rényi, 1961). These theorems show how the logical structure of incompatible viewpoints translates into precise information-theoretic costs—costs that cannot be wished away through clever aggregation or statistical manipulation
