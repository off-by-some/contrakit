### **Theorem 2.** (Representation.)

Any contradiction measure $K$ obeying A0–A4 admits a minimax form

$$
K(P)=h\!\left(\max_{Q\in \mathrm{FI}}\min_{c\in\mathcal C} F(p_c,q_c)\right) = h\!\left(\min_{\lambda\in\Delta(\mathcal C)}\max_{Q\in\mathrm{FI}}\sum_c \lambda_c F(p_c,q_c)\right),
$$

for some per-context agreement kernel $F$ with normalization, symmetry, continuity, DPI, joint concavity, and calibration, and some strictly decreasing continuous $h$. Optima are attained.

*Proof:* Appendix A.7.
