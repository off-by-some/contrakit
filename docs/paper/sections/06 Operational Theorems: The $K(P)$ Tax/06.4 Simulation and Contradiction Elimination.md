## 6.4 Simulation and Contradiction Elimination

**Theorem 10** *(Witnessing for TV-Approximation)*

There exist witnesses $W_n$ with rate $K(P)+o(1)$ and FI laws $\tilde{Q}_n$ such that $\mathrm{TV}((X^n, W_n), \tilde{Q}_n) \to 0$. No rate $< K(P)$ achieves vanishing $\mathrm{TV}$. (achievability via App. A.12; TV lower bound cf. App. A.11)

**Proof Strategy:**

- *Achievability:* View the task as **distributed channel synthesis**: witnesses act as the **common randomness** that coordinates contexts. A resolvability-style construction (Han & Verdú, 1993) specialized to the distributed setting of Cuff (2013) draws a $2^{n(K(P)+\varepsilon)}$ FI codebook and selects an index passing a Bhattacharyya test; multiplicativity then gives $\mathrm{TV}\to 0$.

- *Converse:* A simulator with witness rate $< K(P)$ would contradict the exponent bound in Theorem 9.
