# 7. Operational Interpretations: The Contradiction Toolbox

The formal theory of contradiction provides the mathematical foundation, but practical applications require concrete interpretations. This section develops the operational toolbox for measuring and managing contradiction in real information systems.

We establish that $K(P)$ manifests as a universal "tax" on information processing whenever multiple contexts must be reconciled. The tax appears in compression rates, communication costs, prediction regret, and statistical testing—all with precise quantitative bounds.

The results unify previously disparate impossibility results across quantum mechanics, social choice theory, and distributed computing, showing that they all stem from the same underlying information cost.
