## 7.5 Summary: The Operational Picture

The theorems in Sections 6-7 establish that $K(P) = -\log_2 \alpha^\star(P)$ is a universal **information tax** in every multi-context problem:

- **Storage:** 
  Typical sets expand by factor $2^{nK(P)}$ (Theorem 6, [App. A.3.2](#theorem-a32-minimax-equality), [A.2.2](#lemma-a22-bhattacharyya-properties), [A.5.1](#theorem-a51-minimax-duality), [A.9](#a9-theorem-4-fundamental-formula-log-law))
- **Compression:** 
  Rates increase by exactly $K(P)$ bits/symbol (Theorems 7-8, [App. A.9](#a9-theorem-4-fundamental-formula-log-law), [A.5.1](#theorem-a51-minimax-duality))
- **Communication:** 
  Channel capacity decreases by $K(P)$ (Theorem 13, [App. A.10](#a10-theorem-5-additivity-on-independent-products), [A.9](#a9-theorem-4-fundamental-formula-log-law))
- **Lossy Coding:** 
  Rate-distortion functions shift up by $K(P)$ (Theorem 14, [App. A.10](#a10-theorem-5-additivity-on-independent-products), [A.9](#a9-theorem-4-fundamental-formula-log-law))
- **Testing:** 
  Detection requires $K(P)$ extra bits of evidence (Theorem 9, [App. A.3.2](#theorem-a32-minimax-equality), [A.9](#a9-theorem-4-fundamental-formula-log-law))
- **Simulation:** 
  Variance costs grow exponentially in $K(P)$ (Proposition 7.2, [App. A.2.2](#lemma-a22-bhattacharyya-properties))

The **witness mechanism** provides the unifying explanation: contexts must coordinate through short certificates of rate $K(P)$ to maintain consistency. When witnesses are underfunded, some decoder must fail—creating the fundamental tradeoff captured in Theorem 7.4.

The **geometric structure** (Theorem 15, [App. A.2.2](#lemma-a22-bhattacharyya-properties), [A.10](#a10-theorem-5-additivity-on-independent-products); FI product closure [App. A.1.8](#proposition-a18-product-structure)) reveals that these costs arise from Hellinger angles in probability space. Frame-independence sits at the origin of a natural metric structure, with contradiction measured by worst-context distances that compose additively under products.

Together, these results show that **contradiction is not free**—it imposes an exact, universal tax on all information-theoretic operations, with the tax rate determined by the minimax game $\alpha^\star(P)$ between behaviors and frame-independent approximations.
