## 8.1 Contextuality

In quantum mechanics, contextuality refers to situations where measurement outcomes depend not just on what you measure, but on what else you could have measured simultaneously. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker construction show that certain patterns of correlations cannot be explained by any single "hidden variable" model (Fine, 1982; Klyachko et al., 2008).

The mathematical structure is identical to ours: you have a family of probability distributions (one per measurement context), and the question is whether some global probability law can reproduce all the marginals. In the sheaf-theoretic formulation, this becomes a question about global sections (Abramsky & Brandenburger, 2011).

Our frame-independent behaviors are precisely those that admit such global explanations. The difference is that while contextuality theory asks "Is this possible or not?", we ask "If you force it anyway, what does it cost?" The answer is $K(P) = -\log_2 \alpha^\star(P)$ bits per symbol, with concrete consequences for compression rates, channel capacity, and prediction error.
