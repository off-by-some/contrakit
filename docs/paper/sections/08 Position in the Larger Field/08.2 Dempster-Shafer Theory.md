## 8.2 Dempster-Shafer Theory

Dempster-Shafer theory provides a framework for reasoning with set-valued evidence (Dempster, 1967; Shafer, 1976). Instead of assigning probabilities to individual outcomes, you assign "belief masses" to sets of possibilities. When combining evidence from independent sources, Dempster's rule produces a "conflict mass" that measures disagreement between sources.

Both approaches recognize that multiple perspectives can be simultaneously valid. The difference lies in what we choose to measure. Dempster-Shafer develops calculus for manipulating set-valued beliefs while preserving their plurality. We measure the cost of abandoning that plurality—what you pay when circumstances force you to collapse multiple perspectives into a single answer.

This distinction matters in applications. A sensor fusion system might use Dempster-Shafer methods to represent uncertainty, but when it must output a single control signal, it pays the $K(P)$ tax we identify.
