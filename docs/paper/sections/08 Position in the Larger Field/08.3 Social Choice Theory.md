## 8.3 Social Choice Theory

Arrow's impossibility theorem demonstrates that no voting system can satisfy certain reasonable fairness criteria simultaneously (Arrow, 1951). Condorcet cycles provide concrete examples: three voters with preferences $A > B > C$, $B > C > A$, and $C > A > B$ produce a majority that prefers $A$ to $B$, $B$ to $C$, and $C$ to $A$—an intransitive result.

Our three-context disagreement patterns are information-theoretic analogs of Condorcet cycles. Each pair of contexts exhibits clear correlations, but no global assignment can satisfy all pairwise constraints simultaneously.

Social choice theory identifies when aggregation is impossible in principle. We quantify what it costs to do it anyway. When a system must produce a single output that satisfies multiple constituencies—whether voters, stakeholders, or distributed system components—the information overhead is exactly $K(P)$ bits per decision.

This manifests as witness bits in consensus protocols, metadata in multi-user communication systems, and proof overhead in distributed verification schemes.
