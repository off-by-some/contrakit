## 8.5 The Common Pattern

Each of these areas has encountered the same fundamental issue: local consistency doesn't guarantee global consistency. Quantum measurements can be individually sensible but collectively impossible to explain. Evidence from different sources can individually make sense but collectively conflict. Voters can have individually rational preferences that produce collectively irrational outcomes. Probability distributions can be individually well-defined but collectively incompatible.

Previous work in each area has identified when such problems occur. Our contribution is showing that when you must solve them anyway—when practical constraints force you to produce a single answer despite multiple valid perspectives—there is a universal information cost of exactly $K(P)$ bits per symbol.

This cost manifests identically across domains: as compression overhead, communication surcharge, prediction regret, consensus rounds, or verification complexity. The measure $K(P)$ makes this cost explicit and computable, transforming abstract impossibility results into concrete engineering parameters.
