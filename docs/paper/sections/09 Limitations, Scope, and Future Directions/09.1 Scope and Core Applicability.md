## 9.1 Scope and Core Applicability

The contradiction measure $K(P)$ applies wherever observations can be modeled as distributions across well-defined contexts. The framework requires several conditions:

---

**Multiple Sources with Context-Dependent Reports**:
Information originates from agents situated in distinct contexts, where each report reflects the observer's position or perspective. Whereas Shannon's theory assumes a single coherent source, here we allow multiple sources that need not reconcile.

**Finite Contexts and Outcomes**:
We work with finite alphabets and finite context sets for mathematical tractability. Reports are modeled as draws from finite outcome spaces conditioned on discrete contexts.

**Structural Conflict, Not Measurement Noise**:
The focus is on structural incompatibility of perspectives rather than statistical randomness. Even when every report is noiseless and perfectly reliable, contradiction can persist.

**Complete Context Access**:
We assume knowledge of the context structure and access to context-indexed marginal distributions. The frame-independent set FI must be specified externally.

**Asymptotic Guarantees**:
Most operational results in §6 assume asymptotic conditions (i.i.d. sampling or ergodic limits). Finite-blocklength refinements remain future work.

$K(P)$ is not appropriate when disagreement is dominated by measurement noise, when FI cannot be meaningfully defined, or when data are too sparse to estimate per-context distributions reliably.
