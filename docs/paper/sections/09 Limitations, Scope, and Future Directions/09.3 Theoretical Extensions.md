## 9.3 Theoretical Extensions

**Continuous Variables**:
Extend $K(P)$ using Hellinger affinity on densities $\int \sqrt{p(x)q(x)}\,dx$, with appropriate frame-independent classes (e.g., exponential families, factorizations) and discretization error bounds. This avoids differential entropy complications while preserving operational interpretations.

**Recent Progress**: For Gaussian observational contexts with same mean but different variances ($\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_1^2)$ vs $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_2^2)$), the contradiction measure is exactly computable. The optimal frame-independent approximation is $Q^\star = \mathcal{N}(0, \sqrt{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}^2)$, yielding $\alpha^\star(P) = \sqrt{\frac{2 \sqrt{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}}$ and $K(P) = -\log_2 \sqrt{\frac{2 \sqrt{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}}$. For $\sigma_1=1, \sigma_2=4$, this gives $K \approx 0.161$ bits per observation, verified through numerical integration and optimization. This demonstrates that the continuous extension captures contradictions that vanish in finite discrete approximations.

**Finite-Blocklength Analysis**:
Develop second-order terms and concentration inequalities for the $K$-tax in finite samples. Extend beyond i.i.d. settings using martingale methods or drift bounds.

**FI Robustness**:
Develop sensitivity analysis tools, Bayesian priors over frame-independent sets, and PAC-Bayes-style bounds on $K(P)$ under model uncertainty.

**Contradiction Spectrum**:
Study $K^{(k)}(P)$ measuring contradiction across $k$-context coalitions. Investigate monotonicity properties, phase transitions, and "spiky versus diffuse" contradiction profiles. Early experiments suggest discriminating between concentrated and diffuse contradiction that $K(P)$ alone cannot distinguish.

**Dynamic Contradiction**:
Formalize gradient flows in contradiction space for online context acquisition and adaptive frame selection. May connect to online learning or adaptive consensus protocols.
