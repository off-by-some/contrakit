## 9.4 Computational Advances

**Scalable Optimization**:
Develop column generation and cutting plane methods for large frame-independent polytopes. Use projected flows from dynamic contradiction processes as warm-starts for optimization.

**Approximation Algorithms**:
Create polynomial-time approximations with certified bounds on $\alpha^\star(P)$. Investigate dual-certified subgradients via optimal $\lambda^\star$ in the minimax formulation.

**Online Methods**:
Develop streaming algorithms for $K(P)$ estimation with partial context observation and adaptive context acquisition strategies.
