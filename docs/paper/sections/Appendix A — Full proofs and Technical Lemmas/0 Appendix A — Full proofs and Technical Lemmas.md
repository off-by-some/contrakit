# Appendix A — Full proofs and Technical Lemmas

This appendix provides proofs and technical details for the mathematical framework introduced in *The Mathematical Theory of Contradiction*.

**Standing Assumptions (finite case).**

Throughout Appendix A we assume finite outcome alphabets and that $\mathrm{FI}$ (the frame-independent set) is nonempty, convex, compact, and closed under products. These conditions are satisfied in our finite setting by construction (A.1)
