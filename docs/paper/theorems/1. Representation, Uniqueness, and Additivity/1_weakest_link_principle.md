# Theorem 1: The Weakest Link Principle

The agreement measure $\alpha^\star(P)$ is limited by the worst agreement in any single context. This makes $\alpha^\star$ behave like a minimum aggregator across contexts.


This is an intuitive result. If you have multiple measurement contexts and one of them can only achieve 60% agreement with any explanation, then the overall system can't achieve better than 60% agreement either.

**Statement.**

Any unanimity-respecting, monotone aggregator on $[0,1]^{\mathcal C}$ that never exceeds any coordinate equals the minimum: if $A$ satisfies $x\leq y\Rightarrow A(x)\leq A(y)$, $A(t,\ldots,t)=t$, and $A(x)\leq x_i$ for all $i$, then $A(x)=\min_i x_i$.

Any unanimity-respecting (idempotent), monotone aggregator with a weakest-link cap equals the minimum.

**Assumptions.**

- $\mathcal{C}$ finite, nonempty; $A:[0,1]^{\mathcal{C}} \to [0,1]$.
- $A$ satisfies:
    1. **Monotonicity:** $x\le y \Rightarrow A(x)\le A(y)$.
    2. **Idempotence (unanimity):** $A(t,\dots,t)=t$ for all $t\in[0,1]$.
    3. **Local upper bound (weakest-link cap):** $A(x)\le x_i$ for all $i\in\mathcal{C}$.

**Claim.**
For all $x\in[0,1]^{\mathcal{C}}$, $A(x)=\min_{i\in\mathcal{C}}x_i$.

$$
A(x) \;=\; \min_{i \in \mathcal{C}} x_i \quad \text{for all } x.

$$

**Proof.**

1. Let $m=\min_{i\in\mathcal{C}} x_i$ (exists since $\mathcal{C}$ is finite and nonempty).
2. (i)+(ii): $(m,\ldots,m)\le x \Rightarrow A(x)\ge A(m,\ldots,m)=m$.
3. (iii): $A(x)\le x_i$ for all $i \Rightarrow A(x)\le m$. Hence $A(x)=m$. □

## The Weakest Link in Action

Imagine three witnesses testifying about the same person, but each has different probabilistic beliefs about the hair color. One witness is particularly restrictive - they believe there's zero probability of black hair. This creates a demonstration of the weakest link principle where the restrictive constraint limits the overall agreement.

```python
from contrakit.observatory import Observatory

def weakest_link_cater_observatory(c_peak=0.95):
    observatory = Observatory.create()

    hair_color = observatory.concept("Hair", symbols=["Red", "Black", "Blonde"])
    red, black, blonde = hair_color.alphabet

    witness_A = observatory.lens("Witness_A")
    witness_B = observatory.lens("Witness_B")
    witness_C = observatory.lens("Witness_C")

    with witness_A:
        witness_A.perspectives[hair_color] = {red: 0.70, black: 0.30, blonde: 0.00}

    with witness_B:
        witness_B.perspectives[hair_color] = {black: 0.70, blonde: 0.30, red: 0.00}

    with witness_C:
        witness_C.perspectives[hair_color] = {blonde: float(c_peak), red: float(1 - c_peak), black: 0.00}

    ABC = (witness_A | witness_B | witness_C).to_behavior()
    AB = (witness_A | witness_B).to_behavior()
    AC = (witness_A | witness_C).to_behavior()
    BC = (witness_B | witness_C).to_behavior()

    print("=== Agreements ===")
    print(f"Overall α* across all three witnesses (A,B,C): {ABC.agreement.result:.6f}")
    print(f"Witness A agrees with witness B: {AB.agreement.result:.6f}")
    print(f"Witness A agrees with witness C: {AC.agreement.result:.6f}")
    print(f"Witness B agrees with witness C: {BC.agreement.result:.6f}\n")

    pairs = [("Witness A and B", AB), ("Witness A and C", AC), ("Witness B and C", BC)]
    lowest_pair_name, lowest_pair = min(pairs, key=lambda kv: kv[1].agreement.result)
    print(f"Pair with lowest agreement is {lowest_pair_name} with α* = {lowest_pair.agreement.result:.6f}")

    q_hair_pair = lowest_pair.agreement.feature_distribution("Hair")

    pair_scores_in_ABC = (
        ABC.agreement
        .for_feature("Hair", q_hair_pair)
        .by_context()
        .context_scores
    )

    # Show the hair distribution that optimizes the pair
    print(f"  Hair distribution optimized for {lowest_pair_name}:")
    print(f"    Red: {q_hair_pair[0]:.6f}, Black: {q_hair_pair[1]:.6f}, Blonde: {q_hair_pair[2]:.6f}")
    print("  => Black probability ≈ 0 because C gives it zero probability.")

    lens_display_names = {
        witness_A.observable_name: "Witness A",
        witness_B.observable_name: "Witness B",
        witness_C.observable_name: "Witness C",
    }

    witness_scores = {
        lens_display_names[k[1]]: v
        for k, v in pair_scores_in_ABC.items()
        if len(k) == 2 and k[1] in lens_display_names
    }

    print("\nScores when using the lowest pair's optimal hair distribution:")
    for witness_name, score in witness_scores.items():
        print(f"  {witness_name}: {score:.6f}")
    print("  => The pair witnesses (A & C) achieve their optimal agreement.")
    print("     The third witness (B) scores lower, showing the trade-off.")
    print("     This demonstrates the weakest-link principle in action.")

    scores_full = ABC.agreement.context_scores

    witness_scores_full = {
        lens_display_names[k[1]]: v
        for k, v in scores_full.items()
        if len(k) == 2 and k[1] in lens_display_names
    }

    names = ["Witness A", "Witness B", "Witness C"]
    print("\nScores at the true minimax θ* (all three together):")
    for name in names:
        if name in witness_scores_full:
            print(f"  {name}: {witness_scores_full[name]:.6f}")
    print(f"  min = {min(witness_scores_full.values()):.6f}  (equals overall α*)")

```

**What does this show?**

- Three witnesses have different probabilistic beliefs about hair color
- Witness C is the most restrictive - they give zero probability to black hair
- The pairwise agreements show that A and C have the lowest agreement (0.770)
- The A-C optimal hair distribution reduces probability on black because C has zero probability there
- When evaluated against all three witnesses, B scores lower (0.644) because most of their belief is on black
- The minimax solution finds a balanced explanation where all three achieve equal agreement (0.760)

**Why this limit?** The weakest link principle means the overall agreement α* is limited by the most restrictive constraint. Witness C's constraint forces the optimal solution to put less probability on black, and witness B suffers because their belief concentrates there. This demonstrates how one witness's absolute certainty creates a fundamental limitation that affects the entire system.

**Output:**
```
=== Agreements ===
Overall α* across all three witnesses (A,B,C): 0.760031
Witness A agrees with witness B: 0.853890
Witness A agrees with witness C: 0.770416
Witness B agrees with witness C: 0.875744

Pair with lowest agreement is Witness A and C with α* = 0.770416

Scores when using the lowest pair's optimal hair distribution:
  Hair distribution optimized for Witness A and C:
    Red: 0.473499, Black: 0.126360, Blonde: 0.400141
  => Black probability is reduced because C gives it zero probability.
  Witness A: 0.770416
  Witness B: 0.643880
  Witness C: 0.770416
  => The pair witnesses (A & C) achieve their optimal agreement.
     The second witness (B) scores lower because their belief in black
     is incompatible with C's constraint.

Scores at the true minimax θ* (all three together):
  Witness A: 0.760031
  Witness B: 0.760031
  Witness C: 0.760031
  min = 0.760031  (equals overall α*)
```
